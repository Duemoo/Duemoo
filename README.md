- Hello, I’m Hoyeon Chang.
- I am a first-year PhD student in Language & Knowledge Lab at KAIST Graduate school of AI
- I am fortunate to be advised by Minjoon Seo.
- Prior to KAIST, I obtained B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biological Sciences at Seoul National University.
- I am particularly interested in natural language processing and neuro-symbolic AI.
- My research interests lie in understanding how knowledge representations can be encoded, transferred, and used for inference and reasoning.
- I believe that these understandings can lead us to achieve multimodality and explainability of AI models, which are crucial for safe and reliable AI.
- You can contact me via e-mail: retapurayo@snu.ac.kr
